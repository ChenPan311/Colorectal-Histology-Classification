# Colorectal-Histology-Classification

In this project we trained a number of CNN architecture-based models, with the goal of finding a model that would provide high enough accuracy to classify cell samples into 8 different possible types - tumor, stroma, complex, lympho, debris, mucosa, adipose, empty.
The selected model used to visualize the 8 different types on the image.
